## Setup Environment

Instructions to setup development environment. Development needs to use
`web/app_dev.php` as frontend controller. This file has a ip restriction, to
breaks this limitation just change ip 127.0.0.1 for your remote address from
`$_SERVER` variable. Do the same with file `·∫Åeb/config.php`.

After call file /config.php from browser, the file suggest to install php's
extension intl.

Firsts request to `http://www.project.tld/app_dev.php` returns fail. Show an
error:

```
The stream or file "/var/www/project/var/logs/dev.log" could not be opened: failed to open stream: Permission denied
```

To fix it we call

```shell
php bin/console cache:clear --no-warmup --env=dev
```

And then two errors more apear:

```
Warning: file_put_contents(/var/www/project/var/cache/dev/appDevDebugProjectContainerDeprecations.log): failed to open stream: No such file or directory
Unable to create the cache directory (/var/www/project/var/cache/dev)
```

Looks like some permission issue. So, let's change permissions

```shell
ll /var/www/project/var/cache
sudo chmod 777 -R /var/www/project/var/cache
```

After change permissions the issue continue. So, let's make dev folder

```shell
mkdir /var/www/project/var/cache/dev
```

Issue persists. Next plan is to change permissions of whole shared unit from
vagrant config file_put_contents:

```
config.vm.synced_folder "www/", "/var/www/", mount_options: ["dmode=777,fmode=777"]
```

Finally, If issue persist redirect session path to `/var/lib/php/sessions` in
file `app/config/config.yml`

```yml
save_path: '/var/lib/php/sessions'
```

## Page Crafting

Controllers are on `src/AppBundle/Controllers`, Create a new controller
`TodoController.php` there. This time routes writed as anotations and Actions
just send a Response.

[src/AppBundle/Controller/TodoController.php]

# Bootstrap Integration

First open **Starter template** from Bootstrap web site [14], show HTML and copy
all and paste it on the app/Resources/views/base.html.twig.

Now it's time for add twig blogs of the original base temple on new bootstrap
code. Also add a title and a menu. And put content block inside two divs, .row
and .col-md-12.
